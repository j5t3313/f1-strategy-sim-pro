## üî¨ Technical Implementation

### Tire Performance Modeling
The simulator employs a dual-modal tire modeling approach:

1. **5-Point Curve System** (Primary):
   - User-configurable compound offset relative to SOFT baseline
   - Warmup penalty modeling for initial laps (decreasing effect over first 3 laps)
   - Linear degradation throughout stint with editable rates per compound
   - Performance cliff onset at user-defined wear life threshold
   - Severe penalties beyond user-defined maximum usable stint length

2. **Physics-Based Models** (Fallback):
   - Compound-specific degradation rates (SOFT: 0.08, MEDIUM: 0.04, HARD: 0.02 s/lap)
   - Compound performance offsets (SOFT: -0.8s, MEDIUM: 0.0s, HARD: +0.5s)
   - Exponential penalties for extended stints beyond 20 laps
   - Tire age effects from previous usage (0.02s/lap per aged lap)

### Simulation Engine
- **Fuel Correction**: `Laptime(corrected) = Laptime - (Remaining_Laps √ó Fuel_Per_Lap √ó Weight_Effect)`
- **Stochastic Elements**: Gaussian noise for lap-to-lap variability and base pace variation
- **Monte Carlo Framework**: User-configurable simulation counts with progress tracking
- **Strategy Validation**: Automatic tire availability checking and lap count verification

### Data Management
- **Circuit Database**: Complete 2025 F1 calendar with accurate parameters
- **Session State**: Persistent tire curve configurations across user interactions
- **Export Pipeline**: Structured data preparation for multiple output formats

## üìã System Requirements

### Core Dependencies
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **NumPy/Pandas**: Numerical analysis and data manipulation
- **Matplotlib/Plotly**: Visualization and interactive charts

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimers

### Model Limitations
This simulator is designed for educational and research purposes. Actual F1 race strategies depend on numerous factors not fully captured:

- **Environmental Variables**: Weather conditions, track temperature, surface evolution
- **Human Factors**: Driver performance variations, mistakes, racecraft decisions
- **Race Dynamics**: Safety car deployments, VSC periods, red flag situations
- **Strategic Gaming**: Real-time reactive decisions and competitor interactions
- **Technical Issues**: Reliability problems, damage, setup compromises
- **Regulatory Factors**: Penalty risks, technical regulations, tire pressure monitoring

### Technical Assumptions
- **Linear Degradation**: Models may miss complex thermal and compound behaviors
- **Perfect Execution**: Assumes optimal pit timing without human error
- **Clean Air Racing**: No modeling of dirty air, overtaking difficulty, or track position value
- **Weather Independence**: Dry conditions only (no wet/intermediate tire modeling)

### Usage Guidelines
- Results should not be used for actual racing decisions, betting, or gambling
- Models provide statistical trends rather than exact predictions
- Consider multiple strategies and risk tolerance in decision-making
- Validate results against domain expertise and current F1 knowledge
