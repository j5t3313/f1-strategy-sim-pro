## üî¨ Technical Implementation

### Tire Performance Modeling
The simulator employs a hierarchical tire modeling approach:

1. **5-Point Empirical Curves** (Primary):
   - Compound offset calculation relative to SOFT baseline
   - Warmup penalty modeling for initial laps (decreasing effect)
   - Linear degradation throughout stint with compound-specific rates
   - Performance cliff detection at wear life threshold
   - Severe penalties beyond maximum usable stint length

2. **Bayesian Statistical Models** (Fallback):
   - MCMC inference using NUTS sampling for posterior estimation
   - Linear degradation: `laptime ~ Normal(Œ± + Œ≤ √ó (stint_lap + tire_age), œÉ)`
   - Single posterior sample per calculation for stochastic behavior
   - Trained on fuel-corrected lap times from real F1 telemetry

3. **Physics-Based Models** (Final Fallback):
   - Compound-specific degradation rates and baseline offsets
   - Exponential penalties for extended stints beyond typical windows
   - Tire age effects from previous usage

### Simulation Engine
- **Fuel Correction**: `Laptime(corrected) = Laptime - (Remaining_Laps √ó Fuel_Per_Lap √ó Weight_Effect)`
- **Stochastic Elements**: Gaussian noise for lap-to-lap variability and base pace variation
- **Monte Carlo Framework**: User-configurable simulation counts with progress tracking
- **Strategy Validation**: Automatic tire availability checking and lap count verification

### Data Management
- **Circuit Database**: Complete 2025 F1 calendar with accurate parameters
- **Model Caching**: Efficient storage and retrieval of Bayesian model parameters
- **Session State**: Persistent configuration across user interactions
- **Export Pipeline**: Structured data preparation for multiple output formats

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimers

### Model Limitations
This simulator is designed for educational and research purposes. Actual F1 race strategies depend on numerous factors not fully captured:

- **Environmental Variables**: Weather conditions, track temperature, surface evolution
- **Human Factors**: Driver performance variations, mistakes, racecraft decisions
- **Race Dynamics**: Safety car deployments, VSC periods, red flag situations
- **Strategic Gaming**: Real-time reactive decisions and competitor interactions
- **Technical Issues**: Reliability problems, damage, setup compromises
- **Regulatory Factors**: Penalty risks, technical regulations, tire pressure monitoring

### Technical Assumptions
- **Linear Degradation**: Models may miss complex thermal and compound behaviors
- **Perfect Execution**: Assumes optimal pit timing without human error
- **Clean Air Racing**: No modeling of dirty air, overtaking difficulty, or track position value
- **Data Currency**: Based on 2024 data which may not reflect 2025 car/tire characteristics
- **Weather Independence**: Dry conditions only (no wet/intermediate tire modeling)

### Usage Guidelines
- Results should not be used for actual racing decisions, betting, or gambling
- Models provide statistical trends rather than exact predictions
- Consider multiple strategies and risk tolerance in decision-making
- Validate results against domain expertise and current F1 knowledge
